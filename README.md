# Web-search-engine
Simple web search engine in java using Web Crawler, HTML to Text Converter, Merge Sort, Edit Distance, Java-regex patterns, Radix Sort

Web Crawler : To visit different websites during search dynamically

Edit Distance : This algorithm helps the users to determine the similarity between two strings and gives word suggestions to the user based on the input. Word is suggested by calculating the distance between two words and suggests the word which has least distance 

Radix Sort : This algorithm sorts strings digit-by-digit which helps in finding the pincodes of different cities across Canada

Merge Sort : Merge sort is preferred over quick sort because it is more stable which takes less time than quick sort in worst case scenarios and comparison using pivot takes more time for larger data sets
